**Clean Architecture in iOS Development: A Step-by-Step Explanation**

Let me walk you through the structure of our Tasks app to help you understand how Clean Architecture with use case-based development works in iOS. I'll break down each component, explain their relationships, and then create a diagram to visualize the architecture.
The Foundational Layers
Clean Architecture divides our application into three primary layers:

1. Domain Layer - The core business logic
2. Data Layer - Data storage and retrieval
3. Presentation Layer - User interface elements

**Key Benefits of This Architecture**

Testability: Each component can be tested in isolation with mock dependencies

Flexibility: You can change implementations without affecting other layers

Maintainability: Business logic is clearly separated from UI and data access

Scalability: Easy to add new features by adding new use cases

Team Collaboration: Different teams can work on different layers simultaneously


How to Apply This in Your Own Projects

When starting a new project with Clean Architecture:

Begin by defining your domain entities and use cases

Create repository interfaces for your data needs

Implement your repositories and use cases

Build your UI last, injecting the use cases as dependencies


This approach forces you to think about your business logic first, rather than getting caught up in UI or data access details.
By understanding each component's role and how they interact, you can build iOS applications that are more maintainable, testable, and adaptable to change.
